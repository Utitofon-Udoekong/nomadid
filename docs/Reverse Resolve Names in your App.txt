Reverse Resolve Names in your App
Reverse Resolution for Names in your App
With D3’s Reverse Resolution, you can map wallet addresses back to identifiable names, making it easier for users to view and manage their identities across blockchain transactions. This capability enhances the user experience by providing human-readable names that correspond to blockchain addresses, improving transparency and simplifying the user journey.

Overview
D3’s Reverse Resolution allows applications to map crypto wallet addresses to their corresponding domain names, enabling users to see a recognizable domain instead of a string of characters. This can be used in transaction histories, user profiles, and across decentralized apps (dApps) to give users a clearer picture of who they're interacting with.

Resolve a Wallet Address to a Domain: By performing reverse resolution, users can see the associated domain name for a wallet address, instead of the unrecognizable long address.

Unlock Universal Identity: Show unique, human-friendly names instead of complex wallet addresses user profiles, dApps, transaction logs, helping users easily identify the counterparties they’ve interacted with. This makes decentralized identities more meaningful and accessible.
