Send/Receive Crypto to Names in your App
Send and Receive Crypto to Names
With D3, you can easily resolve human-readable domain names instead of long, complex wallet addresses. By integrating with D3 Connect SDK, your users can send and receive cryptocurrency seamlessly using their names within your app, making transactions more user-friendly and secure.

Overview
D3’s name resolution technology enables users to send and receive cryptocurrency using a domain name, rather than traditional wallet addresses. This reduces the risk of errors in sending funds to incorrect addresses. By implementing this functionality in your app, you offer a smoother experience for users and enhance the usability of blockchain payments.

Send Crypto to a Domain Name: Users can send crypto to a human-readable name (e.g., johndoe*tld) instead of needing to copy and paste long wallet addresses.

Receive Crypto via Your Domain: Allow users to receive payments directly to their names, making it easy to manage multiple cryptocurrencies without needing multiple wallet addresses.

Name Resolution: D3’s infrastructure automatically resolves the domain name to the associated wallet address, ensuring the correct destination for every transaction.

How to Build This
You can integrate D3 Connect SDK to enable name resolution for cryptocurrency transactions in your app. This SDK allows your users to send and receive crypto by mapping domain names to wallet addresses securely and efficiently.
